Data ingestion is the process of importing data from multiple sources into a cloud-based 
storage medium, such as a data warehouse, database, or data mart. The data can come from 
many different sources, including social media platforms, email marketing platforms, 
financial systems, and CRM systems. The data is then sanitized and transformed into 
a uniform format using an extract/transform/load (ETL) process.
